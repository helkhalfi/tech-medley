Hello eveyone
In this post we are going to learn how to build (beautiful) diagrams that you can easily extend and that you can
version control (it's python thus plain text) and no vendor locking.

We are going to build a [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org) diagram
JAM stands for Javasript, API and Markup
to build modern websites and apps.

First, we need to install python library [Diagrams](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com)

```python
pip install diagrams
```

```python
s = 67
print(s)



```
